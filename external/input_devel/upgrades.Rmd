# Upgrades for version 2

1. Current production becomes non-spatial, adjusted with coefficient

     + Notes: 
         + currprod.rda is main file to read

     + Status: __Done__
     

2. Fraction available cropland needs to be incorporated

     + Status: Not yet done
     
3. New biodiversity impact metric incorporated

     + Status: Not yet done

# Fixes

1. Yield standardization procedure

    + Notes: 
        + Might need to move this back to standardizing against each crop


# Sequence

1. `fetch_inputs`

    + including altering carbon-names.rda, dumping cropnames.rda entirely

2. `input_handler`

    + yield_mod_dt
        + fixed to remove pp_curr from list of modified rasters
        + noticed potential standardization issue
        + renamed to just `yield_mod`

3. `targets_dt`

    + renamed to targets
    + replaced scheme for modifying current production with simple modification vector, which draws on vector of current production, with argument named `currprodmod`. 
    + yield_mod argument removed. 
    
4. `constraints_dt`
