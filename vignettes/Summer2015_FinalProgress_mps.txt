End of Summer agroEcoTradeoff Progress Report

Contributions:
-Model grids at 1 sq km resolution
-AgroKnapsack algorithm for optimal allocation of pixels to crops
-Script and function to approximate and plot the Pareto Front given multiple objectives
-Approach to a new biodiversity metric using a model from Newbold et al. (2015)
-Mapping of soil profiles to shapefile polygons

Unfinished Tasks:
-Implement double cropping into the model for crops such as winter wheat
-Create grids of anthropogenic data from online sources and ZARI to implement the new biodiversity metric

Future Priorities:
-Incorporate yield variability into the model based upon historical yields
-Use a land cover grid to define what percentage of each pixel is available for conversion to farmland
-Consider different scenarios based upon type of agriculture (smallholder, commercial) and calorie/nutrition demands 
-Plan 2016 field work to improve input grids and motivate future work on targeting areas for investment/infrastructure development
